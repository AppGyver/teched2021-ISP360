## Scenario

## Application overview
The application comprises of three major parts:
- Backend service that persist store the data and implement backend logic. It exposes the functionality via REST API. This is done in the AppGyver Cloud Mesh (TODO - CLoud Mesh - name under review).
- Frontend to create the user interface (web application) using the service interfaces created in the previous step. This is done using AppGyver Composer.
- Integrating the web-app created in the previous step to SAP Sales and Service Cloud.

## Systems - User Selection & Login

In this step you will familiarise yourself with the systems that will be used in the workshop.

1.	AppGyver system and user.
  - Please select one of the user (TODO: define a way to reserve users) 
  - Login to the following user using the above user

2.	SAP Sales & Service (C4C) system and user
  - Note that we will need C4C system only to access the data via API. The UI intercation steps would be performed by the instructor.
